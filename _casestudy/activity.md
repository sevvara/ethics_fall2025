# Interactive Activity: How Fast Do You Accept Cookies? (Draft)

This page will contain a reaction-time test exploring how fast users click cookie banners.

## Planned Activity Structure

1. **Start Button**  
   Click to begin the test.

2. **Randomized Cookie Banners**  
   - Some “good” cookies  
   - Some “bad” cookies  
   - Some intentionally manipulative designs  

3. **Reaction-Time Tracking**  
   The system measures how quickly users click "Accept All" or "Manage Preferences."

4. **Results**  
   - Your average acceptance speed  
   - Whether you accepted good/bad cookies  
   - Interpretation of what this means  

Full interactive version coming soon.
