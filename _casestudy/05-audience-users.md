Internet users are framed as being “in control” of their data, yet most consent decisions are made under pressure, fatigue, and limited understanding. This page explores why everyday users often carry the consequences of tracking without meaningful power to resist it.

## Users: The People Who Are Supposed to Be “In Control”

Most people do not go online thinking about privacy. They open a browser to read the news, check prices, submit an assignment, or scroll for a few minutes before bed. In these moments, cookie consent banners appear as interruptions, something to get past, not something to carefully evaluate.

Although users are framed as decision-makers in consent systems, the reality is that privacy decisions are made under heavy cognitive load. Understanding what a cookie banner actually means requires time, technical knowledge, and attention, resources most users do not have or are not willing to spend during everyday browsing.

## Why Users Click “Accept All”

Research consistently shows that users accept cookies not because they genuinely agree, but because interface design pushes them in that direction. Buttons labeled “Accept All” are often visually emphasized, while decline or customization options are hidden behind multiple clicks, smaller text, or vague language. Over time, this design trains users to respond automatically.

Fatigue plays a major role. After encountering dozens of banners across different websites, many users stop engaging altogether. Consent becomes a reflex rather than a choice.

In this context, clicking “Accept All” is less about permission and more about convenience.

## What Users Don’t Fully Understand

Many users are unaware of how extensive cookie-based tracking can be. While some understand that cookies “collect data,” fewer understand:
- the difference between first-party and third-party cookies  
- how data follows them across unrelated websites  
- how long identifiers persist  
- or how information is combined into detailed behavioral profiles  

As researcher Tanay Kant describes, users often experience *algorithmic disillusionment*: they recognize that personalization and tracking feel invasive, yet feel powerless to resist or meaningfully opt out. The system appears unavoidable.

## Who Carries the Risk

Although users are the ones whose data is collected, they rarely see how it is used or where it goes. Inferences drawn from browsing behavior, about health, finances, or personal vulnerabilities, can shape ads, recommendations, and opportunities without users’ knowledge.

The ethical imbalance is clear:  
Users bear the long-term consequences of tracking, while having the least control over how consent is structured.

From an ethical perspective, this raises a critical question:  
**If users are expected to manage their privacy, but are given neither the tools nor the power to do so, can consent be considered meaningful at all?**
