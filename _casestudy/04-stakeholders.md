Cookie consent banners may appear to involve only a simple interaction between a website and a user, but the ecosystem behind that single click is crowded with actors whose interests, power, and visibility are unequal. Understanding these stakeholders is essential to understanding why consent so often becomes an illusion rather than a meaningful choice.

## Why Stakeholders Matter in This Case
The ethical problem surrounding cookie consent does not arise from malicious intent alone. Instead, it emerges from conflicting goals embedded in technical systems, systems designed, regulated, and used by different groups with different priorities.

By examining stakeholders separately, we can better understand:
- Who benefits from current consent designs
- Who bears the risks and long-term consequences
- Where responsibility lies when consent is technically valid but ethically questionable

The sections that follow explore each group in greater detail, highlighting how their roles and incentives contribute to the broader problem of digital consent.

## Key Stakeholder Groups
**Internet Users**
Internet users are the individuals most directly affected by cookie tracking, yet they often have the least visibility into how their data is collected, shared, and reused. While users are presented as decision-makers through consent banners, their choices are shaped by limited information, interface design, and the pressure to access content quickly.

The **Internet Users** page focuses on autonomy, understanding, and the everyday experience of consent from the user’s perspective.

**Tech Designers & Companies**
Designers and technology companies build the systems that make cookie consent possible. They operate under business pressures, legal requirements, and performance metrics that influence how consent mechanisms are designed and deployed.

The Tech Designers & Companies page examines how economic incentives, UX decisions, and platform architectures shape consent, and how ethical responsibility fits into those design choices.

**Policy Makers & Regulators**
Regulators aim to protect users by defining what consent legally requires, yet they must translate abstract values like transparency and fairness into enforceable rules. Gaps between regulation and technical reality often leave room for compliance without genuine protection.

The Policy Makers & Regulators page explores the limits of regulation, enforcement challenges, and the role of policy in addressing power imbalances in digital consent systems.

## Moving Forward
Looking at these stakeholders together reveals that the illusion of consent is not caused by any single group, but by the interaction between them. Each audience page builds on this overview, offering a deeper look at how ethical responsibility is distributed, and often deferred, across the digital consent ecosystem.
