This interactive experiment tests your reaction time and decision-making when faced with different types of cookie banners.

**The Hypothesis:** Research suggests that users do not read cookie banners; they merely react to visual cues. [cite_start]Dark patterns exploit this by making the "Accept" action significantly faster and physically easier to perform than the "Reject" action[cite: 160, 161].

### Instructions
1. Click **"Start Experiment"** in the window below.
2. You will be presented with **5 random cookie banners**.
3. Your goal is to **REJECT** non-essential cookies or **MANAGE** preferences whenever possible.

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 30px auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

## Reflection

**Did you feel the friction?** In the activity above, you likely noticed that identifying the "Reject" option became progressively harder. [cite_start]This was not accidental; it was a simulation of **Friction Asymmetry**[cite: 180].

**Key Concept: Structural Consent Failure**
[cite_start]If you found yourself clicking "Accept" just to make the test end faster, you experienced **cognitive fatigue**[cite: 169]. [cite_start]In the real world, this leads to what researchers call "structural consent failure"—where the system is designed to extract consent rather than request it[cite: 173].
