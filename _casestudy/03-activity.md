This interactive experiment tests your reaction time and decision-making when faced with different types of cookie banners.

**The Hypothesis:** Research suggests that users do not read cookie banners; they merely react to visual cues. [cite_start]Dark patterns exploit this by making the "Accept" action significantly faster and physically easier to perform than the "Reject" action[cite: 63, 115].

### Instructions
1. Click **"Start Experiment"** in the window below.
2. You will be presented with **5 random cookie banners**.
3. Your goal is to **REJECT** non-essential cookies or **MANAGE** preferences whenever possible.

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 30px auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

## Class Discussion & Reflection

Use the results from your activity to answer the following questions. These move from your personal experience to broader ethical implications.

### 1. The Personal Experience (Reflection)
* **Reaction Time:** Compare your reaction time on the "Good" banners vs. the "Dark Pattern" banners. How much longer did it take you to find the "Reject" button?
* **Frustration:** Did you feel a moment of hesitation or annoyance when the button wasn't where you expected? [cite_start]Researchers call this "cognitive fatigue"[cite: 51]. Why do you think designers intentionally create this feeling?

### 2. Analyzing the Design (Application)
* **Identify the trick:** Look at the banners you failed to reject. Which specific dark pattern tricked you? [cite_start]Was it a color highlight (Visual Interference) or confusing language (Framing)?[cite: 37, 38].
* **The "Default" Bias:** If you were in a hurry to read a news article, would you have taken the time to reject these cookies? How does the "path of least resistance" shape our online privacy?

### 3. The Ethical Dilemma (Critical Thinking)
* **Informed Consent:** The GDPR requires consent to be "freely given." [cite_start]If a design makes rejecting cookies 5x slower than accepting them, is the user's choice actually free?[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**Structural Consent Failure:** Richards & Hartzog argue that we are experiencing "structural consent failure"[cite: 55]. Based on this activity, do you agree that the entire system of banner consent is broken? What would a truly ethical alternative look like?
