**How Do You Respond to Cookie Banners?**

This interactive exercise is designed to measure how you react to different types of cookie banners. Research in user-experience and human–computer interaction shows that most people do not read cookie dialogs, they respond to visual cues, color emphasis, and interface layout. Because of this, dark patterns often make the “Accept All” option faster and easier to click than “Reject” or “Manage Preferences.”
This activity lets you experience those dynamics directly.

### Instructions
1. Click **"Start Experiment"** in the window below.
2. You will be presented with **5 random cookie banners**.
3. Your goal is to **REJECT** non-essential cookies or **MANAGE** preferences whenever possible.

<div style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 30px auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; overflow: hidden; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

## Discussion Questions & Reflection
These questions guide you through three levels of analysis: your own experience → design choices → the larger ethical problem.

## 1. Personal Experience (Reflection)
**Reaction Time:**
- How did your reaction time differ between clearly labeled banners and banners designed with dark patterns?
- Were you slower when the “Reject” button was hidden or visually de-emphasized?

**Frustration or Hesitation:**
- Did you feel annoyance, confusion, or hesitation when the interface didn’t behave as expected?
 Research on cognitive fatigue shows that extra effort in navigating consent banners pushes people toward quicker acceptance.

 Why might designers intentionally rely on this effect?

## 2. Analyzing the Design (Application)
**Identify the Dark Pattern:**
For any banners you failed to reject, what design element influenced your choice?
- Was it color highlighting of the Accept button?
- Was it ambiguous wording like “Agree & Continue”?
- Was the Reject option hidden behind multiple layers?

**Default Bias:**
If you were trying to quickly access a news article or complete a task, would you realistically take the extra time to reject tracking? How does the “path of least resistance” shape decisions about privacy?

## 3. The Ethical Dilemma (Critical Thinking)
- Is Consent Really “Freely Given”?
Regulations like the GDPR require that consent be voluntary and easy to withdraw.
If rejecting cookies consistently requires more effort than accepting them, can we say users are freely choosing?

**Structural Consent Failure:**
 Some scholars describe today’s consent system as a form of **structural consent failure**,  a system that appears to offer choice but is built so that meaningful refusal is difficult.
 Based on your experience in the activity, do you agree?
 What would an ethical alternative to the current banner system look like?
