**Key Citations (Footnotes 1–5)**
**[1] History & Original Intent**

**Schwartz, J.** (2001, September 4). Giving Web a Memory Cost Its Users Privacy. *The New York Times.*

    - **Context:** Supports the historical background section; establishes that Lou Montulli invented the cookie in 1994 at Netscape to solve the "shopping cart" problem (statelessness), not for surveillance.

**[2] User Psychology & Algorithmic Disillusionment**

*Kant, T.*** (2021). Identity, advertising, and algorithmic targeting: Or how (not) to target your “ideal user”. *MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing.* MIT Press.

    - **Context:** Supports the "Internet Users" page; defines "algorithmic disillusionment", the feeling users have when they recognize tracking is invasive but feel powerless to stop it.

**[3] Dark Patterns & Ethical Drift**

**Gray, C. M., Kou, Y., Battles, B., Hoggatt, J., & Toombs, A. L.** (2018). The dark (patterns) side of UX design. *Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.* ACM.

    - **Context:** Supports the "Tech Designers" page; provides the academic definition of "dark patterns" and supports the argument that design choices are often optimized for shareholder value over user welfare ("ethical drift").

**[4] GDPR Failure & Design Impact**

**Bielova, N., Litvine, L., Nguyen, A., Chammat, M., Toubiana, V., & Hary, E. (2024).** The effect of design patterns on (present and future) cookie consent decisions. *Proceedings of the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium.* USENIX Association.

    - **Context:** Supports the "Policy Makers" page; provides recent empirical evidence that current banner designs systematically violate GDPR requirements for "freely given" and "unambiguous" consent.

**[5] Structural Limits of Consent Law**

**Richards, N. M., & Hartzog, W. (2019).** The pathologies of digital consent. *Washington University Law Review,* 96(6), 1461–1503.

    - **Context:** Supports the "Policy Makers" page; argues that legal compliance alone cannot resolve the power imbalances between users and platforms.
