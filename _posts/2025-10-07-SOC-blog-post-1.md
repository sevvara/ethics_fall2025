*Exploring the human side of technology, how AI changes work, creativity, and the hidden labor that keeps our digital world running.*

When people talk about generative AI, the spotlight almost always lands on the technology, the impressive outputs, the new capabilities, or the fear of machines replacing human creativity. What rarely gets mentioned is the human labor quietly fueling those systems. That’s exactly what this Data & Society panel, hosted by **Aiha Nguyen**, set out to explore in their discussion on *Generative AI and Labor Hierarchies.*
The panel brought together **Dr. Milagros Miceli**, a sociologist and computer scientist who studies the people behind AI datasets, **Russell Brandom**, a journalist covering global tech infrastructures, and **John Lopez**, a screenwriter who helped negotiate the Writers Guild of America’s (WGA) recent AI agreement. Together, they looked beyond the surface of AI and asked a deeper question: who really makes it work?

## Invisible Work, Visible Consequences

Miceli described something that stuck with me: behind every “smart” system are countless workers, often in the Global South, who spend hours labeling images, filtering toxic content, or generating “clean” data for models to learn from. These workers are usually paid a few cents per task, with little job security or recognition. In other words, the digital convenience we enjoy autocomplete, content moderation, chatbots - rests on the invisible shoulders of underpaid labor.

What’s striking is that this isn’t new. As Brandom pointed out, today’s data work echoes earlier outsourcing models call centers, moderation hubs, and business process outsourcing firms that keep the tech industry running but remain hidden from public view. The difference is that AI now hides this labor even deeper behind the myth of “autonomous intelligence.”

## Creativity, Copyright, and the Human Touch

Lopez brought a very different perspective: that of the creative worker suddenly competing with the machine trained on his own profession’s output. He talked about discovering that AI tools like ChatGPT could reproduce scenes from The Godfather or mimic an existing show’s tone, essentially remixing copyrighted scripts without permission. The WGA’s strike last year, he explained, was about drawing a clear line: *AI can assist, but it can’t replace or devalue the human writer.*

I found that argument surprisingly hopeful. It wasn’t anti-technology, it was about redefining authorship in a world where creativity is scraped, compressed, and repackaged by algorithms. Lopez’s point reminded me of the music industry’s struggles when streaming first disrupted everything: musicians didn’t reject digital tools, they demanded fair compensation and ownership. Maybe the AI era needs a similar cultural reset.

## Why This Conversation Matters Now

Listening to this talk made me rethink what we mean when we say “AI is learning.” The truth is, AI doesn’t learn, it’s taught. And those teachers are often workers whose names we’ll never know. That realization raises big ethical questions: if these people are part of the system, why don’t they share in its benefits? Why do we talk about “AI innovation” without talking about the exploitation built into its foundations?

This isn’t just a labor issue, it’s a justice issue. If AI reshapes the economy but keeps replicating old hierarchies (cheap labor, data colonialism, lack of consent), then we’re not innovating, we’re just rebranding inequality in a new technological package.

## I Think

As a computer science student, I found this discussion humbling. It reminded me that every dataset, model, or API I use carries a story about how it was made. It made me think about what ethical coding could look like, not just bias audits or privacy rules, but real respect for the people who make the data possible.

If future developers and project managers design systems with data provenance, opt-in consent, and fair pay for annotation work, we can help rebuild trust in technology from the ground up. Maybe “ethical AI” isn’t just about preventing harm, maybe it’s about redistributing value to everyone who contributes to the process.

## So What? 

The conversation matters because it forces us to see that the ethics of technology can’t be separated from the economics of work. Whether you’re a coder, an artist, or just a user of AI tools, the question isn’t if humans are part of the loop they always are. The question is *which humans, and under what conditions.*

## My Question 

After watching the conversation, I kept wondering: **How might we design AI systems or policies that don’t just make data labor more efficient, but actually recognize and reward the people doing it?**

That question feels central to the whole issue. The panelists emphasized transparency and fairness, but I think there’s still a missing piece redistribution. If millions of people are labeling data, moderating content, or contributing creative work to train models, then those workers should share in the value those models create. It’s not just about preventing harm; it’s about reimagining how value flows in the digital economy.
