In this episode of Etiquette, Sevara and Alex explore how characters from popular culture ranging from superheroes and video game icons to real-world figures fit (or clash) with classic ethical frameworks. Using lenses like virtue ethics, utilitarianism, care ethics, and deontology, they debate Gordon Ramsay’s fiery discipline, Joel’s heartbreaking choice in The Last of Us, MrBeast’s philanthropy as spectacle, and more. Along the way, they challenge each other to see whether moral decisions are driven by outcomes, duties, relationships, or character. The conversation is fun, thoughtful, and a great way to make philosophy feel practical and alive.
