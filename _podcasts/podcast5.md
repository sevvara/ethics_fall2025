## about memes
For this assignment, we focused on memes not just as jokes or casual media, but as meaningful cultural forms. Inspired by the article, we dive into how memes create shared meaning, why certain formats feel instantly relatable, and how platform culture shapes the way we communicate. We talk about concrete meme examples, how we personally interpret them, and how meme-based thinking affects how we read news, communicate emotions, and understand social situations, both online and offline.
