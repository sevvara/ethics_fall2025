Welcome to my site for Computing Ethics. Here you’ll find my case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on course readings and discussions. This space is where I’ll share my work, highlight what I’m learning, and give visitors a sense of how I’m thinking about the connections between technology and society. Content will be added soon as the course progresses.


About Me 
---
Hi, I’m Sevara Murodova, a Computer Science student at St. Olaf College with a concentration in Business and Management. I enjoy working on projects that bring together coding, problem-solving, and organization, and my internships in both tech and HR have given me a broader perspective on how people and technology intersect. These opportunities have helped me develop technical skills while also learning how collaboration and structure shape outcomes.

Research 
---
My current interests lie in technologies like blockchain and data analysis, especially the ethical questions they raise around privacy, security, and fairness. I’m curious about how digital systems can be designed to protect users while still driving innovation, as well as how automation is reshaping decision-making and everyday life.

Personal Life
---
Outside of academics, I like exploring graphic design, diving into medical topics, and reading. I also spend a lot of time with my Beagle puppy, Lalo, who keeps things lively. Traveling and connecting with people from different backgrounds has been an important part of my life, and it continues to shape how I see the world.
