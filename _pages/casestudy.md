# When “Accept All” Means Everything: How Cookie Consent Normalizes Data Surveillance

Every time users click **“Accept All”** on a cookie banner, they participate in one of the largest invisible data-collection systems online. While cookies were originally meant to improve user experience, they now fuel cross-site tracking, advertising, and behavioral profiling. This case study explores why meaningful consent rarely exists, how companies design banners to nudge users, and what happens to data once it begins circulating across the web.

# Interactive Activity Preview (Draft)

This project includes an interactive test that measures **how fast you react to cookie banners**.  
Users will respond to randomized “Accept All / Manage Preferences” pop-ups, and the system will track:

- reaction time  
- whether you accepted “good” or “bad” cookies  
- behavioral patterns  

The activity will appear on the **Interactive Activity** page.

# Discussion Questions (Draft)

1. Is informed consent possible when people click automatically?  
2. Should laws require “Reject All” to be as visible as “Accept All”?  
3. Who should be responsible for preventing dark patterns?  
4. Do users have real control over how their data circulates?  
5. How can transparency be improved?
